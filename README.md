# Design
## Color scheme
The colors used in the app design is intended to make it playful, cool and young. Shades of light grey, white (#fff, #CCC) and orange (#ff652f) are the main colours used in the design and stand out against dark transparent containers (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)) on top of a dark background on all three pages of the site.

A hover effect ever so slightly changes the shade of each option box to a lighter shade of grey (#252525) to give the user an interactive feel when playing the quiz. Green and Red background colours update both the answer indicators at the bottom of the questions container and option boxes when correct and incorrect options are selected.

The site's footer text and social media font awesome Icons are also in harmony with the sites colour scheme of orange and light grey. So also is the site logo visible on every page. The dark backgrounds make it easy to look at the screen for long period's of time.

## Typography
"Lato" and "Oswald" with "Sans serif" as the fall back font in the event a browser does not support the first choices.

## Images
A variety of images mostly of sneakers used as part of the questions makes the quiz more fun and adds to the variety of types of questions that can be asked during user sessions. The stand out logo image gives the site character and makes it appealing to its young users.
