# Design
## Color scheme
The colors used in the app design is intended to make it playful, cool and young. White (#fff) and orange (#ff652f) are the main colours used in the design and stand out against dark transparent containers (rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5)) on top of a dark background. this is the colour scheme throughout the site.

A hover effect ever so slightly changes the shade of each option box to a lighter shade of grey (#252525) to give the user an interactive feel when playing the quiz. Green and Red background colours update both the answer indicators at the bottom of the questions container and option boxes when correct and incorrect options are selected.

The site's footer text and social media font awesome Icons are also in harmony with the sites colour scheme of orange and light grey. So also is the site logo visible on every page. The dark backgrounds make it easy to look at the screen for long period's of time.

## Typography
"Lato" and "Oswald" with "Sans serif" as the fall back font in the event a browser does not support the first choices.

## Images
A variety of images mostly of sneakers used as part of the questions, makes the quiz more fun and adds to the variety of types of questions that are presented during user sessions. The stand out logo image gives the site character and makes it appealing to a young audience.

## Wireframes
[Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) was used to create the wireframes:

  ### Further testing
The web application was tested on the 5 most commonly used browsers for browser specific compatibility errors.The types were Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Internet Explorer, Safari and Firefox. No errors were identified on any of the browser platforms.

The application was viewed and played on the following devices a Windows' desktop PC, a ProBook-450-G4 laptop, IPhone7, Samsung Galaxy S7 and S9. The app functioned as it should on the various device sizes, barring tablets. Detail is provided in the bugs section.

User testing was carried out by Friends and family members in an effort to locate known bugs and or user experience issues.

## Bugs
* A small portion of the viewport at the bottom of the page on tablets when being used in the portrait position, was not covered by the whole of the page's background as a result the repeat attribute was used to ensure cover which may bevisible to the user.  

The user input field was removed due to problems with getting the script to work consistently therefore there is a difference with the wireframes and actual interface of the app in the live environment.
